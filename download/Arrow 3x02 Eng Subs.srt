1
00:00:01,434 --> 00:00:04,003
My name is oliver queen.

2
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,971
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:08,507
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,442
To save my city.

5
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,878
Now others have
joined my crusade.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,314
To them, I am oliver queen.

7
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:17,549
But to the rest
of starling city,

8
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,018
I am someone else.

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,553
I am something else.

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,821
Previously, on "arrow"...

11
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:25,124
My name
is amanda waller,
mr. Queen.

12
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:28,093
Welcome
to hong kong.

13
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:33,232
Amanda waller
wants you working for her.
She will have her way.

14
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,000
You're felicity smoak.
I know a guy who might

15
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:37,236
Be interested
in hiring someone
with your expertise.

16
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:39,004
Apparently there's another
bidder for the company.

17
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:41,573
Who?
Ray palmer.

18
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:44,476
What are you
doing here?

19
00:00:48,782 --> 00:00:52,117
No! No! Sara!

20
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:53,886
Sara!

21
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:56,855
No! No!

22
00:00:56,857 --> 00:01:00,426
[sobbing]

23
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:03,362
Please!

24
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:10,636
Felicity,
all I'm trying to do

25
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,004
Is make things
easier on you.

26
00:01:12,006 --> 00:01:13,772
By having me
completely

27
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,341
Reconfigure
our phone system?

28
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,743
Do you even know
how difficult it is

29
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,746
To ping a clone
off a hacked
transband multiplex?

30
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:25,684
No, but only because
you weren't speaking
english just now.

31
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:32,958
Sara?

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,760
I didn't know
where else
to take her.

33
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,395
Felicity: Oh, my god.

34
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:38,597
Oh, my god! Oh.

35
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,299
What happened?

36
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,467
I couldn't...

37
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:44,336
I couldn't
leave her.

38
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:49,808
Felicity: We have to--
call--we can...

39
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,944
Take her
to the hospital!

40
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:59,685
Ollie. Ollie,
it's not fair!

41
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,921
We just got her
back, it's not fair!

42
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,102
Come here...

43
00:02:17,104 --> 00:02:20,139
I'm so sorry.

44
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,375
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:28,213
I'm so sorry.

46
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,224
We'll take
our position here.

47
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,593
Who's your target?

48
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:45,030
I don't have a target--

49
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,832
You do.

50
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:46,832
What?

51
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,767
Might have escaped
your notice,

52
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,370
But amanda waller
doesn't have a sense of humor.

53
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:51,370
Oh, really?

54
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:54,039
Then why'd she drag
me off of lian yu

55
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,240
And bring me all
the way to hong kong

56
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,176
To become her hit man?
To become her operative.

57
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:59,811
Obviously she needs you
for something or she wouldn't
be threatening my family

58
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:05,784
To assure your compliance.
The target will be entering
our line any moment.

59
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,094
The target will walk 10 paces
through the roof garden

60
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,798
And arrive at his hotel suite.
That's your window.

61
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,900
I see it.

62
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,039
Now.

63
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,113
Tommy?

64
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:45,023
You know, sara used
to have a stuffed animal.

65
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:48,660
It was this old,
worn out shark

66
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,896
That she got
from the starling aquarium.

67
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,065
Every time something awful
would happen to her,

68
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,669
I would always
find her holding
that stupid little shark

69
00:03:57,671 --> 00:03:59,171
Close to her chest.

70
00:03:59,173 --> 00:04:02,474
And now that my sister's dead,

71
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:05,711
Again the only thing
that I can think about

72
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:09,014
Is finding that dumb
stuffed animal

73
00:04:09,016 --> 00:04:12,317
And putting it in her arms.

74
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,854
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,523
You have nothing
to apologize for.

76
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:20,626
Hey, whoever
did this,

77
00:04:20,628 --> 00:04:22,494
I'm going
to find them.

78
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:24,363
We're going to.

79
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,565
When I thought that sara
died on "the gambit,"

80
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:28,166
The only thing
that I could do

81
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,568
Was scream at the ocean.

82
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,736
I had so much anger and rage,

83
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,971
And I didn't know
what to do with it.

84
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:33,839
But I do now.

85
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,407
And I'm going
to help you catch

86
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,777
Whoever it is that did this.

87
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,849
You're already helping.

88
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,517
Laurel...

89
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,152
You told us
where to look.

90
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,455
I'm just supposed
to sit here and wait?

91
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,891
No. Now you take
care of yourself

92
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,560
And your family.

93
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,529
Your father is
going to need you.

94
00:04:57,531 --> 00:04:59,665
Telling him now,
it would kill him.

95
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:04,269
At least now if we wait until
we catch whoever did this,

96
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,738
It'll be easier on him.

97
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,441
Ok.

98
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:10,475
Where are you going?

99
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,978
I don't know.
I don't know
anything anymore.

100
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,915
But I know that
a bar is the last
place I should be.

101
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,255
[dialing]

102
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:25,290
[exhales]

103
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,224
Come on, pick up.

104
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:29,328
Thea: You've reached thea.
Leave a message.

105
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,330
Thea, it's oliver.

106
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,964
Um...

107
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,533
I know you're still
traveling,

108
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:37,035
But I just,
I could really...

109
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,871
I'd really like
to hear your voice.

110
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:43,342
So please call me back.

111
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,312
What'd we get off
the cameras?

112
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,347
Place is
a drug haven.

113
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:49,815
They've all
either been
disabled

114
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:52,084
Or paint-balled
by local dealers.

115
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,218
Where are you going?

116
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,120
Where it
happened.

117
00:05:55,122 --> 00:05:58,156
[horns honking in distance]

118
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,509
Felicity told me.

119
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:54,079
[sighs]

120
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,015
You ok?

121
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,951
Killer stood there,

122
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,820
Loose gravel
on the rooftop.

123
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,955
Oliver...
Sara was here.

124
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:05,590
Scuff marks
back to the edge.

125
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,426
You don't have to do this
right now, man.

126
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,794
It's the only thing
that I can do.

127
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,729
Listen, I get it.
Military training.

128
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:14,266
Stay on task.
Your friend gets shot,
you just keep fighting.

129
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,634
But oliver...
I'm fine.

130
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,803
Well, I'm here
for you just the same.

131
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:19,471
Listen, sara was
my friend, too.

132
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:22,507
And if you think
you're going after
the person who did this solo,

133
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:25,410
You couldn't possibly
be more wrong.

134
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:31,016
[cell phone vibrating]

135
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:32,951
Yeah?

136
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:35,954
Detective lance called,
he says it's important.

137
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,390
Do you think
he knows about sara?

138
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:44,863
[sighs]

139
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,836
[voice disguised]
what is it, detective?

140
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:56,641
You ok? You look
like someone peed
in your cornflakes.

141
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,611
That kind of day, huh?

142
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,613
What's going on?

143
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:04,082
Another archer
in town.

144
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,717
Dropping bodies.

145
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:08,587
Seen this guy's
work before?
I might have.

146
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:11,189
You know where
scpd's finest
might find him?

147
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,024
Who's the victim?
John burke.

148
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:15,160
Some corporate
financier
from qurac.

149
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:16,962
Seems like
he wandered into
the wrong part of town

150
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,964
Tonight looking
for a little local
"entertainment."

151
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,800
He ended up
with an arrow
to the chest.

152
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,870
Hey.

153
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:28,006
You watch your back,
all right? Whoever
this guy is...

154
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,542
He's a killer.

155
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,479
Her hands are so small.

156
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:11,650
I never noticed before.

157
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:15,387
She was always so strong
and brave. [sniffs]

158
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:19,391
I always envisioned her
as this sort of

159
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,260
Amazonian warrior.

160
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:24,763
Invincible.

161
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:28,633
Something I could
never be.

162
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,570
I was so jealous.

163
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:32,537
[sniffs]

164
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:35,340
[cell phone vibrates]

165
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:42,113
Hi. I know I was
supposed to come
into work today.

166
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,348
I--the--I'm sorry.

167
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,217
There's been a death
in the family.

168
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:46,217
Thank you.

169
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:49,888
You have any idea
what other archer
could have done this?

170
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,857
[exhales]
there aren't
that many of us.

171
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,359
Maybe 10 that I know of,

172
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,561
And most of them are in
the league of assassins.

173
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,096
Oliver,
you don't think...

174
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,098
No. No.

175
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,300
They don't
target their own.

176
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,635
What'd you find out?
He hit again.

177
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:05,770
An abandoned warehouse
on the corner of
third and lemire.

178
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:10,342
Ninth floor. The victim
was a construction
foreman, tim kauffman.

179
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:11,943
Security cameras
can't get an angle.

180
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,979
Who's that?
Just some low level dealers

181
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:16,047
That set up shop
in abandoned warehouses.

182
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:17,482
Doesn't look like
much of an archer to me.

183
00:10:17,484 --> 00:10:19,084
He might be a witness.
Diggle: Where do you want me?

184
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:21,186
Will lyla give you access
to a.R.G.U.S.'s database?

185
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:23,588
To find out who did
this, lyla will give us
access to a.R.G.U.S.

186
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,660
I need a list of everyone
on their radar--assassins
and mercenaries who use a bow.

187
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,562
I'm on it.

188
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:35,166
What?

189
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:40,238
Uh, thea hasn't
called back yet.

190
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:48,480
You didn't
eliminate the target!

191
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,116
That's not a target,
that's my best friend!

192
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:53,652
Why am I pointing a gun
at my best friend?

193
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,687
Is this
some sort of test?

194
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:57,489
Yes. One you failed!

195
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,623
Good. Flunk me.

196
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,226
You think it's a coincidence
your friend just happened

197
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,394
To show up in hong kong?

198
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:03,928
He's here looking for you!
What?

199
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:08,033
When you logged into your email,
it set off an account alert.

200
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,502
Dead men don't check
their email, oliver.

201
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,803
Oh, so this is
my fault?

202
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14,005
Waller needs you.
She can't let you
be compromised

203
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,608
By some rich kid flashing
your picture all over hong kong.

204
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:19,444
Whether you're the one
who pulls the trigger or not,

205
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,048
She wants tommy merlyn
off the board.

206
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:36,695
That is a cobalt
encrypted workstation.

207
00:11:36,697 --> 00:11:38,697
You better not be
using it to tweet.

208
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,300
I was--I was,
um, actually just...

209
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:45,537
Accessing an fbi database?
What...

210
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,006
Roy, why are you
looking for thea?

211
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:50,709
Because I don't
think she is where
she says she is.

212
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:53,478
Why would she lie?

213
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,953
Roy, oliver needs to see this.

214
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:04,322
No. This is my fault.
He's going to kill me.

215
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,291
What if she's in trouble?
What if she's not?

216
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,059
What if she just
needs space?

217
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,227
She's had five months

218
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,962
And thousands
of miles of space.

219
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,098
Oliver needs to see this.

220
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,733
[exhales]

221
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,901
You need to show it to him.

222
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,903
[sighs]

223
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,672
[cell phone vibrates]

224
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:23,208
You have got to be kidding me.

225
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,310
What--where
are you going?

226
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:29,114
There's someone
I need to kill.

227
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:31,816
[elevator dings]

228
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,220
Did you do it to make a point?

229
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:38,323
Because I get it.
Loud and clear.

230
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,024
You are rich.
You are impulsive.

231
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,726
And frankly, you are
the creepiest form of stalker

232
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,128
That I have ever
had to deal with,

233
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,897
And believe me when
I'm telling you that
that is saying a lot,

234
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,767
And--what are you doing
to our old offices?

235
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,935
Hi. I'll be right back.

236
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,437
You like it? Yeah,
I'm just trying

237
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,571
To liven up
the place a bit.

238
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,140
I'm hosting
an event tonight.

239
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,508
A pledge drive of sorts.

240
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,643
Got to make
an impression, right?

241
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,411
Now, what can I do for you?

242
00:13:00,413 --> 00:13:03,481
You can stop.
You can stop
sending me flowers,

243
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,016
And you can stop
texting me
and calling me

244
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,552
And emailing me,
because I spam
them, anyway.

245
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:08,787
Oh, is "spam" a verb now?

246
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:11,923
Because I am never,
ever, ever going
to work for you.

247
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,992
Actually, you already do.

248
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:16,528
Only because you
bought the store
that I work at!

249
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,129
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did!

250
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,800
My boss just called
and told me that you did.

251
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,935
Well, he's wrong--kind of.

252
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:27,071
I bought the holding company
which owns and operates

253
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:28,606
All 20,000 tech village stores.

254
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:32,043
But I guess either way,
yes, I am your boss now.

255
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,045
So you can either
work for me here

256
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,114
In a big office
with a big salary,

257
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,483
Or...You can work
for me there,

258
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:41,052
In that awful uniform.

259
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,855
Or...I can quit.

260
00:13:43,857 --> 00:13:46,891
Which is what
I just did.

261
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:48,426
[scoffs] you know,

262
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:51,830
Most girls would be
flattered that I spent
$1.2 billion to hire them.

263
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:55,333
Even if I do have
a fairly genius plan
for revamping the stores.

264
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,969
In case you haven't noticed,
I am not most girls.

265
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,572
And I don't
need this. Or you.

266
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:00,572
Or any of this.

267
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:04,342
Felicity, I--I piss people
off on a daily basis.

268
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,678
It's part of business,
and, well,

269
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:06,678
Being the smartest guy
in any given room.

270
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,049
I own that. So I have
enough experience with
people being angry with me

271
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:14,085
To know when
they're really angry
at something else.

272
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,021
You right now are not
angry at me.

273
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,624
What's your something else?

274
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:20,658
[inhales, exhales]

275
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
Oh, money won't
fix this problem.

276
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,796
Money won't solve
most problems.

277
00:14:24,798 --> 00:14:27,031
Not the ones that matter.

278
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,633
But talking helps.

279
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,869
I know we barely
know each other...

280
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:32,403
I'm going
to leave now.

281
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,707
Listen, whatever
happened, sorry.

282
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,109
It helps to remember that...

283
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:41,880
It gets better.

284
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:47,051
[elevator dings]

285
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:10,508
[both grunt]

286
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,015
Someone was murdered here.
Tell me what you saw.

287
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,250
I saw nothing.

288
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,985
[groaning]

289
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,154
There was
a black face mask,

290
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:26,691
Like a--like
a hockey mask.

291
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,459
Now, please, man--

292
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,763
Diggle, are you
at a.R.G.U.S.?
I've got something.

293
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,531
Yeah, I'm here.

294
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:36,768
I got a list of archers
20-long, man.

295
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,503
How many of them
wear masks?

296
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,637
Only one.

297
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,174
Simon lacroix.
Mercenary.

298
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:44,442
Goes by "komodo."

299
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,511
Send felicity
everything.

300
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:46,511
Yep.

301
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:49,814
Oliver, I'm opening up
the file now.

302
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:49,814
Laurel: Is that him?

303
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:52,083
Simon lacroix. Born in
saint-sophie, quebec.

304
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,218
Raised by a single mom.
Terrible credit score.

305
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,854
Oh, and wanted
for murder
in seven countries.

306
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:59,791
I need his location.
One minute.

307
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:00,825
Put him on speaker.

308
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:05,930
Ok, indexing all active
burner cell phones
within the city limits.

309
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,398
There's got to be
10,000 phones.

310
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,969
Yes, but how many
are making calls
to dear old mom

311
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,470
In saint-sophie, quebec?

312
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,440
I got him.
He's on the move.

[tires squealing]

314
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,373
I found lacroix.

315
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:49,807
I need to see
what's happening.

316
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:53,678
Ok. Blowing up
street camera feed.

00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,761
[tires squealing]

319
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,246
Come on, ollie.

320
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,382
Get up.
Oliver?

321
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,417
Are you ok?

322
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,585
Oliver?

[revving engine]

325
00:18:22,668 --> 00:18:26,003
He got away.

326
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,716
I had him, diggle.

327
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,585
The way you look,
he almost had you.

328
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,220
Where's roy?

329
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,254
He's out canvassing.

330
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,822
Tell me about
the driver of the car.

331
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:47,625
His name is erlich
kelso. He just got out
of starling general--

332
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,293
And where are we
with lacroix?

333
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,495
He ditched
his burner.

334
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:52,163
I'm searching the city
for any calls made to quebec.

335
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:54,298
We used that to track
him once; he's not going
to let it happen again.

336
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,634
All right, so why
don't we stop
searching for lacroix

337
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,969
And start searching
for his target?

338
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,171
Because there
must be a connection
with his victims.

339
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:02,673
Already on it.

340
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,712
I mean, what if we just--
we go to a local morgue

341
00:19:07,714 --> 00:19:11,516
And we find a body
that looks like tommy's?

342
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:13,050
At the hong kong morgue?

343
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,886
You've got a better chance
of winning the lottery

344
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:16,754
And trying to pay waller off.

345
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:18,656
I am not going
to assassinate
my best friend,

346
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:23,628
Do you understand?
There has to be
another way.

347
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,296
There is.

348
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:27,398
But it involves
amanda waller

349
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,369
Finding someone else
to execute your friend.

350
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,173
No, not you, dad.
Look, I'm already
in hong kong.

351
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,608
No! No, I didn't tell you
I was taking the jet

352
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:39,310
Because I knew you would
freak out like this.

353
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:42,547
No, I don't know
how long, ok?
It doesn't matter.

354
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:47,785
Listen, if oliver
is still alive,
if he is still here--

355
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:47,785
[grunts]

356
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:54,625
Look, why don't you just
go back to banging
your pilates instructor, ok?

357
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:01,332
I'll just
be here searching
for my best friend.

358
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,101
[gasps]

359
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:09,774
I'm sorry, miss.
You can't go in there.

360
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:13,477
Laurel lance.
I'm with the district
attorney's office.

361
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:14,912
Erlich kelso
is a witness

362
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,214
Of my ongoing
investigation.

363
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,815
Mr. Kelso's under
protective custody.

364
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,785
Not from me.
And if you have
a problem with that,

365
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:21,752
You can call
your captain.

366
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,223
Tell him his
daughter says hello.

367
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,395
Who are you?

368
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,897
I work in the da's office.

369
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:33,965
I already
told the police,

370
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,367
I don't know
anything.

371
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,204
I still have to ask you
a few questions.

372
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,575
Why isn't
this working?
It is.

373
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:46,477
It's running an nsa
algorithm aggregating

374
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:48,112
The victims' personal
information using

375
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:50,481
Every government database
known, and unknown.

376
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:53,618
Well, it's taking too
long. Sara's killer
is still out there,

377
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,720
Which means that
every minute that
we waste down here--

378
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:58,089
I know! You don't
need to tell me

379
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:00,691
As if I don't already know.

380
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,593
You're right.

381
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:07,198
And I apologize.
I just need your a game
right now, felicity.

382
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,100
I don't have it!

383
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:12,370
My friend--our friend--

384
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,605
Was shot with arrows
and fell off of a rooftop.

385
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:18,209
Her body is upstairs
right above us in a freezer

386
00:21:18,211 --> 00:21:21,646
Because we don't know
what to do with it--

387
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:22,947
With her.

388
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:24,749
So I am so sorry, oliver,

389
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:29,720
If I have feelings, but maybe
if you did, too, we...

390
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,155
Sorry.

391
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:35,526
That was mean.
But this is sara
we're talking about.

392
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:36,761
Your sara.

393
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:40,665
How can you stand there
being so cold

394
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:41,832
And rational?

395
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:45,336
'cause I don't
have the luxury
of falling to pieces.

396
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,506
Everyone's looking to me
to handle things,

397
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,175
To make the right
decisions.

398
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:54,278
Everyone
is looking to me...

399
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,447
To lead.

400
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:58,983
If I grieve,

401
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:01,686
Nobody else gets to.

402
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,691
You're still
a human being, oliver.

403
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,759
You're allowed to have feelings.

404
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:11,462
I know sometimes
that it's easier

405
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,064
To live under that hood.

406
00:22:13,066 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm not.

407
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,908
Earlier today,
I was looking at sara,

408
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:27,311
I realized something.

409
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:32,483
One of these days
it's going to be me.

410
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,151
And this...[sighs]

411
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:39,323
This life that
I've chosen...

412
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,625
It only ends one way.

413
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:43,461
So that's it?

414
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:45,062
You're just going
to spend your life

415
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,398
Hiding down here
in this cave,

416
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,601
Waiting to die?
I'm sorry.

417
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,969
I'm not going
to wait with you,

418
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:55,172
Because if there's
one thing that
today has taught me,

419
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,007
Is that life is precious.

420
00:22:57,009 --> 00:23:03,381
And I want so much more
in mine than this.

421
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,318
[sighs]

422
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:15,192
Let's start
with the obvious.

423
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:18,496
Why would someone
want to kill you?

424
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,231
I have no idea.

425
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,466
This whole thing,
it's insane.

426
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:24,802
Mr. Kelso, despite
what you may have heard,

427
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,238
Homicides at the hands
of a stranger

428
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,606
Are incredibly rare.

429
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:33,477
Imagine how rare homicides
by bow and arrow are.

430
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,979
Yeah, the guy
was a sicko.

431
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,747
And you're a liar.

432
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,583
I'm the victim here.
You're also a witness--

433
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,719
My witness. And you better
give me something useful,

434
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:44,188
Otherwise you're going to be
facing an obstruction charge.

435
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,556
You know, I think I want
to talk to your boss,

436
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:47,158
Because you can't
treat people like this.

437
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,460
Oh, really, you want
to talk to my boss?

438
00:23:49,462 --> 00:23:51,362
Ohh!
How's your arm feeling?!

439
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,396
What are you doing?!

440
00:23:52,398 --> 00:23:54,532
John burke and tim kaufman,

441
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,200
They were also shot by
with arrows.

442
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:57,902
And they're too dead
to tell me why.

443
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:59,403
Can't.

444
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:01,105
Ohh!
Burke and kaufman!

445
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:03,140
What do the two of them
have to do with you?

446
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,608
We were all
working on a deal!

447
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,045
But nobody
was supposed
to know about it.

448
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:11,015
Ohh! Ohh.

449
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:12,750
What kind of deal?

450
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:15,486
To build
an oil pipe line.

451
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,556
For amertek. It's--

452
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,580
Thea: You've reached thea.
Leave a message.

453
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:45,449
Hey, thea, it's me. Again.

454
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:49,353
And...I don't know
if you're getting
these messages,

455
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:51,489
But I would really
like to talk to you.

456
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:53,991
So please, just...

457
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,560
Call me back.

458
00:24:56,562 --> 00:24:59,630
Bye.

459
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,602
Lyla has multiple
teams trying to get
an angle on lacroix.

460
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:07,204
[sighs]
where's felicity?

461
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:09,006
Hmm.

462
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,541
She needed some air.

463
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,842
And what do you
need, oliver?

464
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:16,080
I just need thea
to call me back.

465
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:25,956
That's not going
to happen.

466
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,762
Why? What do you mean?

467
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,610
It was during the siege.

468
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:49,113
We were going
to run away together,
but I couldn't leave

469
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:53,484
Without helping you fight.
And when I came back,
she was gone.

470
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:58,222
I didn't say anything
because this is my fault.

471
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,857
She knew I was lying
to her the entire time.

472
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,059
I'm sorry I didn't
say anything about
the letter.

473
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,162
I know that
I should have.

474
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,502
Ok.

475
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,610
Felicity, I really
need to talk to you,

476
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:22,980
So please, can you...
Call me back as soon
as you get this.

477
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:25,849
Laurel! Baby,
are you all right?

478
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,651
Are you hurt?
I'm fine.

479
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,687
Baby, a guy just
got skewered right
in front of you.

480
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:31,088
I hope
you're not fine.

481
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,123
And what the hell
were you doing here
in the first place?

482
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,225
The district attorney's office--

483
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:36,493
Did not send you.

484
00:26:36,495 --> 00:26:38,896
You lied to my officers
and now what,

485
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,931
You're just going
to stand there

486
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,200
And you're going
to lie to me?

487
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:44,935
I needed to talk to him.
It was important.

488
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,438
Look, sweetie,
I know you want
to help,

489
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,974
But you don't
need to take
these kind of risks,

490
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,976
You understand?
Pretty sure
your sister's

491
00:26:51,978 --> 00:26:54,845
Got that covered
for the both of you.

492
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,014
Yeah.

493
00:26:57,016 --> 00:27:00,351
Go home.
We got this.

494
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,319
Ok?

495
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,221
[cell phone vibrates]

496
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:09,426
I've got something.
Meet me at verdant.

497
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:10,628
Amertek industries.

498
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,663
It's an oil company
based in starling city.

499
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:14,231
Ok. Now that
I've consolidated

500
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,433
All of lacroix's
victim's records,

501
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,235
I can run
the algorithm,
scan the data

502
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,803
And see who received
money from amertek.

503
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,005
How long does that take?
Not long.

504
00:27:21,007 --> 00:27:24,208
Three to kelso,
one more to burke,
two more to kaufman.

505
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,677
All from a subsidiary
from amertek in qurac,

506
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:29,446
Which just happens to be
the largest untapped
oil field on the planet

507
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:32,383
Yeah. Looks like
amertek was trying
to strike an oil deal.

508
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,717
And some paid lacroix
to stop it.

509
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,285
None of this explains
how sara was involved.

510
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,620
Sara once told me
she worked in qurac.

511
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,589
And by "worked,"
I mean she killed
people for the league.

512
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:40,991
You're saying she might
have brought her work
home with her.

513
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,028
Who authorized the payments?

514
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,497
A board member of amertek
called tom westin.

515
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:50,367
He's lacroix's
next target.
What's his location?

516
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:53,303
You will not believe
where he's headed.

517
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,973
[sighs]

518
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:59,043
Where do you think
you're going?

519
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,711
I'm coming with you.
Absolutely not.

520
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,646
Oliver, the only reason
why you know where
to find him is because--

521
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:06,784
You were reckless.
And lacroix almost
put an arrow in you.

522
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,821
Let me handle this.

523
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:13,857
Don't you dare tell me
to stay put and think
that I'll listen!

524
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:13,857
You know me better than that.

525
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:18,662
Sara was trained by some
of the greatest killers
in human history.

526
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,330
Lacroix put her down.

527
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,166
So what do you think
he's going to do to you?

528
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:23,734
I don't care about anything
except for getting him.

529
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:25,803
And I will.
You couldn't before!

530
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:28,205
I won't let him
escape again.

531
00:28:28,207 --> 00:28:30,874
I promise.

532
00:28:43,688 --> 00:28:46,857
[indistinct chatter]

533
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,702
Thank you.

534
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:00,170
Thank you all
for coming out tonight.

535
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,406
Given all that has
befallen this city,

536
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,874
It's easy for us to lose hope--

537
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:07,277
To hide in our castles
and be thankful that our
ledges are in the black.

538
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,415
Well, we, the city's
most affluent
businessmen and women

539
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,617
Hold its future in our hands.

540
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,154
Tonight, I'm making a pledge.

541
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:19,590
I will give away
half of my net worth

542
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,658
To the benefit of our home.

543
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,895
And this will be my salary
for the year.

544
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:29,233
So tonight, I invite you all
to join me in this investment.

545
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:32,903
Not just with your money,
but with your ingenuity,

546
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,105
And most importantly,
your time.

547
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,342
The city is my home,
but it's yours, too.

548
00:29:38,344 --> 00:29:42,913
So help make star city
our future.

549
00:29:47,352 --> 00:29:50,554
[all screaming]

550
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:07,037
[both grunting]

551
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,594
Let go of the arrow.

552
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,263
I thought
you'd be taller.

553
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:08,031
It's over.

554
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,634
Lower your bow and live.

555
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:14,304
We both know
that's not
going to happen.

556
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,883
Who hired you?!
Who's she?

557
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:27,351
You don't want
to do this.

558
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:28,752
Yes, I do!

559
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,787
Killing him
won't bring her back.

560
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:33,757
I know it won't bring
her back, she's dead!

561
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,592
I have stood where
you are right now;

562
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,694
Where you're so consumed
with rage you can

563
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,363
Hardly breathe,
and you think that

564
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,098
Taking revenge
will make it better,

565
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,101
But laurel...It won't.

566
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:46,036
It only makes it worse.

567
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:48,238
No, he murdered sara!

568
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,940
Who's sara?

569
00:31:49,942 --> 00:31:52,342
My sister, you son of a bitch!

570
00:31:52,344 --> 00:31:53,176
Two nights ago,

571
00:31:53,178 --> 00:31:56,346
You put an arrow in her chest.

572
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,115
Two nights ago

573
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:01,652
I was drunk
in bludhaven.

574
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,554
You're lying.
I'm proud of my work.

575
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,623
I wouldn't deny it.

576
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:07,724
Even with a gun in your face?

577
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:10,227
Laurel, you need to stop
and listen to him.

578
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,695
No.

579
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,397
No, he killed my sister.

580
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:14,831
Laurel, sara
wouldn't want--

581
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,233
Don't you dare tell me

582
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:18,535
That this isn't what
sara would have wanted!

583
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:20,270
Don't you tell me
to think of her,

584
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,805
Because I am
thinking of her!

585
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:23,473
Laurel, if you pull
that trigger--

586
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:26,610
[clicking]
[sirens]

587
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:29,713
You took the bullets
out of the gun!

588
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:33,216
We have to go.

589
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,028
Lacroix's alibi
checks out.

590
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:48,498
Two murders in
bludhaven, same mo.

591
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,334
Same night
sara was killed.

592
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:51,268
I almost killed lacroix.

593
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:54,604
The only thing that
matters is you didn't.

594
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,939
Laurel...

595
00:32:55,941 --> 00:32:57,607
The trail's
run cold.

596
00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:01,712
I'm going to find
whoever did this.

597
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,914
I will.

598
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:06,483
But I don't know when.

599
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,354
Your father
deserves to know.

600
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,493
[inhales, exhales]

601
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:20,430

602
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,899
Lance: Hey, listen.

603
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:27,371
I got some word on the boy.
Yeah, some stuff's come through.

604
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:30,240
I don't know. Yeah.
It looks pretty good,
it looks pretty good.

605
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:33,276
Lacroix, with an "x."
yeah. I don't know,
the guy's french

606
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,512
Or something,
why you asking--

607
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,583
Oh, hold on, hold on.
I got to call you back.

608
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:43,387
Laurel, baby, what's wrong?

609
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:48,658
Hold on.

610
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,761
What is it?

611
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,729
Just tell me.
Tell me, what is it?

612
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:55,265
It's about last night.

613
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:58,101
At the hospital.

614
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:00,370
I lied to you.

615
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:03,673
And you deserve to know
the truth, and--

616
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,709
[beeping]

617
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:05,709
Sorry, sweetheart.

618
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:12,416
Damn thing
goes off every hour
if I don't take my pills.

619
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:14,618
Laurel, what do you know?
You looked like you were

620
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,553
In the middle
of telling me something.

621
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:20,724
I just wanted
to say that...

622
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,827
That I'm really sorry.

623
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,729
I know that I should
have told you the truth,

624
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,164
I just...

625
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,732
I just got to--

626
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,368
Hey, I'm your dad.

627
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,737
I forgive you.

628
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,372
Come here.

629
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:38,341
I always forgive you.

630
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,177
[exhales]

631
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,746
It's all right.

632
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:48,652
She can rest now.

633
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:51,888
She's home.

634
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,877
It's a jewish custom.

635
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,078
I know she wasn't,

636
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:18,248
But it feels right.

637
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,723
Laurel.

638
00:35:59,725 --> 00:36:03,393
No, this isn't right.

639
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:08,165
This isn't--
it--she doesn't even
get a fresh grave?

640
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,867
It's so perverse.

641
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:14,571
She deserves a proper burial.

642
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,507
She's earned it.

643
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,075
No, it's not fair.

644
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:22,812
No one will ever
really know
who she was.

645
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:25,549
Oliver, it's not fair.

646
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:28,985
It's not fair!

647
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:47,671
Laurel, we'll know.

648
00:36:47,673 --> 00:36:49,105
I know this doesn't
count for much,

649
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:55,078
But me and lyla,
we're naming the baby sara.

650
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,448
We will never forget.

651
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,284
Thank you.

What the hell
is going on here?

656
00:37:24,009 --> 00:37:27,244
Where am I?

Please, please don't--
please don't hurt me.

659
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,918
Just--just
let me go, please.

660
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,754
I promise, I--I won't
tell anybody about this.

661
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,690

throw his prized catch
back into the sea?

[scoffs] what
are you talking about?

663
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,597
Look, whoever you are,

664
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,099
You really don't
want to do this.

665
00:37:49,101 --> 00:37:52,702
Do you have any idea who
I am? Who my father is?!

666
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,437
You're thomas merlyn.

667
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,607
You've been looking
for oliver queen.

668
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,942
How--how do you--
how do you know that?

669
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:02,612
A simple hack of a missing
billionaire's email account.

670
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:04,714
I knew somebody would come
looking for him,

671
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,917
But I thought it would be
his...Mother.

672
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:11,288
His sister.
But you, the son

673
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:14,624

674

you are going to make me

677
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:22,932

Oliver queen is dead.

00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:34,511
He's rotting
at the bottom
of the ocean.

682
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:37,814
And you will, too,

683
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,583

pay that ransom.

00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,927
It's ok.
Thank you!

687

You're going home.
You're safe now.

00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:11,548
I'm going to catch
whoever killed her.

00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:17,921
And until you do,
I'm back on the team.

00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,358

your family?

00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,992

00:39:30,836 --> 00:39:34,237
Now I got to go get thea.
